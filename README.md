## Memory game

This is a game written in haskell that shows you sequences of specified characters in terminal, and then asks you to recall them. By using arguments you can specify what kind of characters should be used, what length the sequences should be and what time you should have for memorising them. The programs help mennu shows how to use these arguments.
